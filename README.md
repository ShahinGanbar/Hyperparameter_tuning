# Hyperparameter_tuning

Task : Optimize the hyperparameters of a machine learning model to improve its performance.
Details:
Model Selection: Choose a machine learning model (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost).
Hyperparameter Tuning: Use techniques like Grid Search, Random Search, or Bayesian Optimization to find
the optimal hyperparameters.
Evaluation: Assess the model performance using cross-validation and metrics such as accuracy, precision,
recall, and F1 score.
Documentation: Document the tuning process and the final model performance.
Where to Do It:
Scikit-Learn: Utilize tools for hyperparameter tuning.
Optuna: Use for advanced hyperparameter optimization.
Google Colab: Develop and test hyperparameter tuning experiments.
